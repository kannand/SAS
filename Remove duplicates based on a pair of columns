Remove Duplicates Based on a Pair of Columns
Options
3 hours ago

Hello,
 
I have run into a task in SAS that, though appearing easily accomplished, has actually proved to be quite tricky.
 
I have a dataset that looks like this:
 
ID     A     B     C
1      a      e     #
2      c      f      #
3      e      a     #
4      f       c     #  ,
 
where A and B are identifiers and C is the common field between the two. In this particular instance, rows 1 and 3 are duplicates while rows 2 and 4 are duplicates.  I need to find a way to remove the instances of duplication.  There may be an easy answer to the problem, but I may have been looking at it too long to notice it Smiley Very Happy.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
MS

As with many problems, there are many ways to solve this, using a hash table, proc sql, or a data step.   Here is a way using simple data steps...
data in;
input ID VAR1:$1. VAR2:$1. VAR3:$1.;
DATALINES;

1      a      e     #
2      c      f      #
3      e      a     #
4      f       c     # 
;
RUN;
PROC SORT DATA=IN;
  BY VAR1 VAR2;
RUN;
PROC SORT DATA=IN OUT =REV;
  BY VAR2 VAR1;
RUN;

DATA DUPES;
     MERGE IN (IN=A RENAME=(VAR1=V1 VAR2=V2 ID=ID1 VAR3=V3))
           REV(IN=B RENAME=(VAR1=V2 VAR2=V1 ID=ID2 VAR3=V3));
        BY V1 V2;
     IF A & B;
     IF ID1 NE . AND ID2 NE . 
     THEN KEEP_REC=MIN(ID1,ID2);
RUN;
PROC SORT DATA=DUPES OUT=FINAL(KEEP=ID V1 V2 V3) NODUPKEYS;
  BY KEEP_REC;
RUN;
PROC PRINT;
Here is the output it generates...
Obs	V1	V2	V3
1	a	e	#
2	c	f	#
Hope this helps.... Good Luck...!!!

One way would be to create a pair of new variables:
 
data want;
set have;
if a < b then do;
   minval=a;
   maxval=b;
end;
else do;
   minval=b;
   maxval=a;
end;
run;
 
proc sort data=want nodupkey;
   by minval maxval;
run;
 
You could always drop minval and maxval later.
 
Good luck.
